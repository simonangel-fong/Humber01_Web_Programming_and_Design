                    As a member of the <u>Argus tribe</u>, an ancient tribe with long history derived from the <u>Greek
                        Golden Ages</u>, I might sound idiosyncratic.
                    <br>
                    Compared to my fellows, most of who admire the elegant lifestyle of the old time, I prefer to look
                    up at the sky and <a href="./mydream.html">dream</a> of the future.

                <h2>About Argus Tribe</h2>
                <p>
                    In the major branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology">Greek mythology</a>,
                    <b><i>Argus</i></b>, or <b><i>Argos Panoptes</i></b> is a many-eyed giant. In fact, we were
                    servants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera">Hera</a>, the wife of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus">Zeus</a>. And we served our Godness with a gift of
                    wakeful alertness, which makes us the perfect guardians. So we have different names
                    like <strong>watchers</strong> or <strong>angels</strong> in the many works of literature. Some of
                    our stories lead to a game named <b><i><u>Assassin's Creed</u></i></b>.

                    After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k"><b>Ragnar√∂k</b></a> , the events in
                    which ancient gods ascended to their thrones in constellations in the sky, we live with humans and
                    help their civilization in many forms. Our ancestors planted the apple tree beneath which
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"><i>Sir Newton</i></a> established the
                    foundation of
                    <strong>classical mechanics</strong>. Also, they patronized many
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">Renaissance</a> artists, like <i>Piero da
                        Vinci</i>, <i>Michelangelo</i>,and <i>Raffaello</i> . Our whisper gave <i>Albert Einstein</i> a
                    clue to think of the formula of <b><code>E = mc<sup>2<sup></code></b>, which lead to
                    the revolution of energy.
